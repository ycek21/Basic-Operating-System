# Basic-Operating-System

Poznan University of Technology
Jacek Eichler

The main goal of creating BOS was to simulate the operating system. It consists of several modules as:

- RAM memory
- Virtual memory
- File and folder system
- Processor manager
- Processes management
- Locks and synchronization mechanisms
- Interpreter
- Pipelines
- Shell

Project was created by group, where every individual was supposed to simulate assigned module. The most challenging task to do was to merge 9 modues all together. My job was to create the interpreter, which you can find in file called interpreter.h. Every function is commented, that will give you some information to understant how it works. To run project on your computer I recommend using Visual Studio and just simply running BOS.vcxproj file, which will link every files all together.

Hope you enjoy
